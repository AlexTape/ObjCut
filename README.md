# ObjCut
Simply cut Segments from an input image..

Put the images you want to cut from into ObjCut/ObjImages.

Create class folders in ObjCut/CuttedObj for each indice you want to use. (e.g. 1, 2 and 3)

Compile and run the tool. It will show you each image from ObjImages folder. You can drag a rectangle (not visible) 
on the shown image. after this press the indice number (e.g. 1) and the content of the rectangle/the segment will 
be saved in CuttedObj/1/imagename_1.jpg (or whatever extension it got).

Quite easy.. but somehow usefull.
